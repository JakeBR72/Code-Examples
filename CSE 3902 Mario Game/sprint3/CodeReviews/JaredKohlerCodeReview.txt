Work could be done on the organization of the fields and properties at the top of the file as they are not sorted
in any logical way that I can tell. Cyclomatic complexity is kept at a low throughout the whole class as the class
correctly refers to other classes with certain functionality. While the class uses multiple other classes each class
that is used is not used beyond what is needed and avoids reading the data of other classes.

If Bowser were to be given a new attack pattern in which he lounges towards mario the style of this class would easily 
allow it. A new command class would be made to take care of the new attack pattern like the current fire ball command 
class does.
