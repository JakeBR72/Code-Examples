This cs file is pretty basic but very helpful for the game. It allows the game to be better optimised for different types of devices 
and is simple and easy to follow along with. There is no hard to follow logic or unnecessary ideas in this class and seems rather easy to add to or
remove from. 

there is also an option to disable this which is a useful feature.

all in all it covers all the basics, and is expandable if it needs to be.
