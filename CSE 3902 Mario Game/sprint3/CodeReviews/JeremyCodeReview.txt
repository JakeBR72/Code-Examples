The Cheater class is pretty well written and 
runs well without any noticeable effect on 
performance. The long line of if checks in the
GetPressedButtons() method is a little troublesome, 
though there is not much that can be done aside 
from creating a lookup table for all of these 
checks and then iterating through it. But that would 
not really change a whole lot in terms of performance.
The class is largely cohesive and every part seems
to only do one particular thing.
