LevelEditor.cs
Jacob Ruth

The LevelEditor class has only one major dependency (the game instance), and the overall complexity of the class is much
cleaner than I would have expected for something as in-depth as a level editor. Cyclomatic complexity is not a concern, as 
the most "complex" component of the class is just a switch statement nested in an if block. Additionally, the class is highly
cohesive, all logic present is necessary and serves only the level editor.
