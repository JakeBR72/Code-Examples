	The final sprint's burndown chart was very chaotic. When we first added tasks we had a
general idea of what we wanted to get done and add, but as time progressed we added some 
potential features and removed others. After we agreed on the features we wanted the work
moved along smoothly and quickly. Hence the very apparent decline near the end of the 
project time frame. Once again the app 'GroupMe' proved to be invaluable with team
communication and debugging. Overall we accomplished the final goals however due to the
nature of changing/adding features our burndown chart suffered.
