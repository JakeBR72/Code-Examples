Readable Code:
The file is very short, sho it is already pretty readable.
it is orginized pretty well and given good names, so it is not hard to follow logical steps.
Methods are split up nicely and spaced well so it is not garbled together into a big wall of text.

there is no real unreadable code in this section, although i could recommend that the different methods could probably
be made into a more general one that takes, what the type is, and various sorts so it applies to all of them without having the 
different methods that do relativelty the same thing. would reduce bloat significantly.
