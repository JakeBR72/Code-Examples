Readable code:

The class is pretty readable, there is a fair amount of logic
but it does not branch very much nor does it branch deeply. 
All of the logical checks are short and concise and only 
do one thing. 

Unreadable code:

The most difficult part to read is probably the KonamiCode()
and KonamiCodeController() methods. They take a few read 
throughs to really understand what is going on. To help with
this it may just be useful to rename the variables to something
a little bit more self evident.
