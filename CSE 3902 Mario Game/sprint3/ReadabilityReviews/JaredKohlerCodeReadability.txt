Readable: Fields and properties are kept to a minimum with esstential values only kept. The lines of code inside the 
class are under 100 which is the course goal for classes, additionally each method is under 25 lines of code again being
the proper size. The class also refers to other classes such as commmand classes and physics in order to limit the amount
of code within the class and place it in other places.

Unreadable: The only organizational issue with the global variables is that two private fields surrond 
the group of the properties.
